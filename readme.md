# My Framework
[Lecture page: Automation tools](https://kb.epam.com/display/GDOKB/Lecture2%3A+JS+automation+Tools+and+Code+quality+tools+and+practices)

### Homework Variant a
In homework i used:
* to manage dependencies: npm
* to build project: gulp
* to check code quality: eslint
* to test framework: jasmine
I need not to rewrite each and every file to use 'strict mode', because Babel do it for me.

### To start example:
1. Clone project.
2. In folder '~/Hw2/my_framework' run 'npm i'.
3. Run 'npm start'.

To run tests: 'npm test'.
